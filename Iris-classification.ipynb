    "This project centered on constructing a robust classifier for Iris species classification using the well-known Iris dataset initially introduced by Ronald A. Fisher. The project spanned various key phases, each playing a pivotal role in enhancing our understanding of the dataset and building an accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "the dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris/data) and found to be relatively clean, requiring only minimal preprocessing. Notably, labels were simplified by removing the \"Iris-\" prefix, and outliers were retained due to the dataset's limited size, containing just 150 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dimensionality Reduction](#dimensionality-reduction) section explored using various dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. While these techniques fell short of creating separate clusters for all three classes, a more focused approach targeting \"versicolor\" and \"virginica\" emerged, using feature elimination to zoom in on petal attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Model Development and Evaluation](#model-development-and-evaluation) phase involved a two-step model. PCA was employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by SVM for preliminary classification. For cases requiring differentiation between \"versicolor\" and \"virginica,\" feature elimination was applied to focus on petal length and width, with a Logistic Regression model making the final distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was rigorously evaluated through 100 tests involving randomized training and testing data. The results demonstrated robust accuracy, averaging 0.96Â±0.03 in testing data, reinforcing the model's effectiveness in Iris species classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, This project was successful in building a dependable Iris species classifier. The model's adaptability, combining dimensionality reduction and feature elimination, has proven to be a potent strategy. Beyond this project, the insights gained extend to complex classification problems, offering valuable lessons and reinforcing their applicability in future data science and research endeavors."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iris dataset, originally introduced by the renowned British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, has long served as a fundamental benchmark in the fields of classification and clustering. This dataset, consisting of measurements of Iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, has become a classic toy problem for data analysis and machine learning. This project's goal is to build an accurate classifier capable of identifying an Iris flower's species with a minimum accuracy threshold of 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our overarching goal of accurate Iris species classification, we have established the following key objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: \n",
    "\t- Collect the Iris dataset from a reputable source, ensuring data integrity and completeness.\n",
    "\t- Conduct meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, addressing any missing values or anomalies that may affect the quality of the data.\n",
    "2. **Preliminary Data Exploration:**\n",
    "\t- Conduct an initial exploration of the Iris dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.\n",
    "\t- Generate summary statistics and visualizations to identify potential issues, patterns, or outliers in the data..\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "\t- Handle outlier detection and treatment to ensure the dataset is suitable for modeling.\n",
    "\t- Encode categorical variables and handle any other data-specific preprocessing tasks.\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "\t- Identify and select the most relevant features for classification.\n",
    "\t- Implement feature scaling, normalization, or dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the model's performance.\n",
    "5. **Model Development and Evaluation**:\n",
    "\t- Explore and experiment with various classification models, possibly including ensemble methods, to determine the most suitable approach.\n",
    "\t- Employ rigorous evaluation techniques, including data splitting for training and testing, to assess and fine-tune model performance.\n",
    "\t- Evaluate the models using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, to provide a comprehensive understanding of classification performance."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has involved a series of critical steps, each contributing to our understanding of the dataset and the development of a robust model:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection and Cleaning\n",
    "The initial phase involved gathering the Iris dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). The data was mostly clean already and didn't have any missing values so cleaning and preprocessing was unnecessary. The only preprocessing step that was deemed necessary was renaming the class labels to remove the `Iris-` prefix for simplicity. While outliers were detected in the dataset, their removal was deemed inappropriate due to the dataset's limited size of 150 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary Data Exploration\n",
    "Preliminary data exploration shed light on the structure and characteristics of the dataset. It allowed us to generate summary statistics and visualizations, which revealed the presence of distinguishable clusters for the \"setosa\" class. However, challenges emerged in cleanly separating the \"versicolor\" and \"virginica\" classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Scaling the features is an option that was considered, however using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a later step deemed feature scaling uncessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "Various dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the data into 2 dimensions were tested; namely, PCA, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). It was discovered that none of these were enough on their own to cleanly separate the three classes, `setosa`, `versicolor`, and `virginica`, into 3 distinct classes. All the techniques have made a distinct cluster for `setosa` but the datapoints for `versicolor` and `virginica` are bunched up with each other. However, it was found that isolating the classification of `versicolor` and `virginica` while using feature elimination to focus on their petal lengths and widths made the classification easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Development and Evaluation\n",
    "The final model employed a two-step approach. Firstly, we used PCA for dimensionality reduction, which provided two informative features. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was then utilized to classify datapoints into either \"setosa\" or \"versicolor/virginica.\" If a datapoint was classified as \"setosa,\" it was directly output. In cases where the SVM assigned a datapoint to \"versicolor/virginica,\" feature elimination was employed to focus solely on petal length and width. A Logistic Regression model then distinguished between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Performance\n",
    "Our model's performance was evaluated through 100 tests, each involving randomization of training and testing data. The results showcased a high level of accuracy in the training data, averaging 0.97Â±0.01, and a slightly lower but robust **accuracy of 0.96Â±0.03 in the testing data**. These findings demonstrate the model's ability to effectively classify Iris species, providing accurate results with a small margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project represents a successful endeavor in the construction of a reliable classifier for Iris species classification. Our model's robust performance in testing data, combined with the use of dimensionality reduction and feature elimination techniques, reinforces the practicality and accuracy of this classification solution. Furthermore, the project offers valuable insights into the relevance of specific features, dimensionality reduction, and the impact of feature elimination in solving complex classification challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge and experience gained from this project not only contribute to the broader field of data science but also offer a solid foundation for addressing similar classification problems and expanding the scope of future research in this domain."
